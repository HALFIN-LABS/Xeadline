# Xeadline vs. Reddit: Key Differences and Advantages

## Overview

This document outlines the key differences between Xeadline and Reddit, highlighting the unique features and advantages of Xeadline's decentralized approach. While Xeadline draws inspiration from Reddit's community-focused design, it fundamentally reimagines the social platform experience through decentralized protocols and economic incentives.

## Architectural Differences
