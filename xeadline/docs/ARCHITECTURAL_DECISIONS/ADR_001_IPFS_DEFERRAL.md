# Architectural Decision Record: Deferral of IPFS Integration

## Status
DECIDED - March 18, 2025

## Context
- Research was conducted into using IPFS as a decentralized storage solution for Xeadline
- A comprehensive proposal was created outlining implementation strategy, performance considerations, and progressive decentralization approach
- The proposal is documented in '../IPFS_PROPOSAL.md'

## Decision
We have decided to defer the integration of IPFS at this time. The current storage solution (Vercel Blob/Supabase) will continue to be used.

## Implications
### Positive
- Reduced implementation complexity in the short term
- Faster development velocity by focusing on core features
- More time to observe IPFS ecosystem maturity
- Opportunity to evaluate other decentralized storage solutions as they evolve

### Negative
- Continued reliance on centralized storage
- May need to migrate content later if/when we implement a decentralized solution

## Future Considerations
- Monitor IPFS ecosystem development
- Evaluate alternative decentralized storage solutions
- Consider revisiting this decision when:
  1. Core platform features are more mature
  2. User demand for decentralized storage increases
  3. IPFS tooling and infrastructure improves
  4. Team capacity allows for complex infrastructure changes
