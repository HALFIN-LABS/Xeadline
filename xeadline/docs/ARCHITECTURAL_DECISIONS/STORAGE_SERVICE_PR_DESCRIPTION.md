# Storage Service Abstraction Implementation

This PR implements the Storage Service Abstraction as described in ADR-003 and the Storage Service Implementation Plan. The implementation provides a pluggable storage system that decouples the application from specific storage providers through a well-defined abstraction layer.

## Key Changes

- Creates a `StorageProvider` interface for all storage operations
- Implements `VercelBlobProvider` as the primary storage provider
- Adds a `StorageService` to manage providers and provide a unified API
- Implements caching and performance monitoring
- Removes S3-related code and dependencies for file storage
- Updates all components to use the new abstraction

**Important Note**: While this PR removes Supabase S3 as a storage provider for file uploads, it preserves the Supabase database functionality that logs image URLs from Vercel Blob and maps them to the relevant topics. This metadata storage in Supabase is separate from the file storage functionality and is maintained.

## Implementation Details

### Core Components

1. **StorageProvider Interface**: Defines a common interface for all storage providers with methods for store, retrieve, delete, list, and getUrl operations.

2. **VercelBlobProvider**: Implements the StorageProvider interface using Vercel Blob.

3. **StorageService**: Manages provider instances and provides a unified API for storage operations.

4. **CachingStorageProvider**: Adds caching capabilities to any storage provider.

### Updated Components

1. **blob.ts**: Updated to use the new storage service abstraction instead of direct Vercel Blob API calls.

2. **simple-blob-upload.js**: Updated to use the storage service for file uploads.

### Removed Components

1. **s3.ts**: Removed as we're focusing exclusively on Vercel Blob for storage.

2. **S3ImageUpload.tsx**: Removed as we're no longer supporting S3 uploads.

### New Components

1. **test-storage-service.js**: API endpoint for testing the storage service.

2. **test-storage-service.html**: Test page for interacting with the storage service.

## Testing

The implementation includes comprehensive testing capabilities:

1. **API Testing**: The `test-storage-service.js` API endpoint allows testing of all storage operations.

2. **UI Testing**: The `test-storage-service.html` page provides a user interface for testing the storage service.

3. **Integration Testing**: The existing image upload functionality has been updated to use the new abstraction, ensuring backward compatibility.

## Benefits

1. **Improved Flexibility**: Easy to add or switch storage providers in the future.

2. **Better Maintainability**: Centralized storage logic with clear separation of concerns.

3. **Enhanced Performance**: Caching layer improves performance for frequently accessed content.

4. **Improved Reliability**: Consistent error handling and retry mechanisms.

5. **Better Monitoring**: Visibility into storage performance and reliability.

## Migration Strategy

The implementation follows a non-disruptive migration strategy:

1. **Parallel Implementation**: Built the new system alongside the existing one.

2. **Adapter Layer**: Updated existing components to use the new abstraction.

3. **Gradual Adoption**: Migrated components one by one to ensure stability.

## Documentation

Comprehensive documentation is provided:

1. **README.md**: Detailed documentation on how to use the storage service.

2. **Code Comments**: All code is thoroughly documented with JSDoc comments.

3. **Test Page**: Interactive test page for exploring the storage service capabilities.

## Next Steps

1. **Performance Monitoring**: Add more detailed performance metrics and monitoring.

2. **Additional Providers**: Implement additional storage providers as needed.

3. **Advanced Caching**: Enhance the caching provider with more sophisticated strategies.
