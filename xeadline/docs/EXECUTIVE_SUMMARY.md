# Xeadline: Executive Summary

## Project Overview

Xeadline is a decentralized Reddit alternative built on the Nostr protocol and integrated with Bitcoin's Lightning Network. The platform combines the community-focused design of Reddit with the censorship-resistance and user ownership inherent to decentralized protocols, creating a unique social platform where users truly own their data and content.

## Vision & Mission

**Vision**: To create a decentralized social platform that empowers users with true ownership of their content, community governance, and economic participation.

**Mission**: To build a Reddit-like experience on decentralized infrastructure that is intuitive for mainstream users while leveraging the unique capabilities of Nostr and Lightning Network.

## Key Differentiators

1. **Decentralized Architecture**: Built on Nostr protocol, ensuring censorship resistance and user data ownership.

2. **Economic Layer**: Lightning Network integration enables micro-payments, content monetization, and anti-spam measures.

3. **Flexible Moderation**: Communities can choose their moderation approach, from post-publication (Reddit-style) to pre-approval or hybrid models.

4. **User Sovereignty**: Users control their identity through cryptographic keys and can interact with the platform through various clients.

5. **Performance Focus**: Multi-level caching strategy ensures responsive user experience despite decentralized backend.

## Target Audience

1. **Existing Reddit Users**: Looking for alternatives with better privacy, ownership, and monetization options.

2. **Crypto Enthusiasts**: Bitcoin and Lightning Network users interested in social platforms aligned with their values.

3. **Privacy-Conscious Users**: Individuals concerned about data ownership and censorship on traditional platforms.

4. **Content Creators**: Looking for direct monetization options without platform intermediaries.

5. **Community Builders**: Wanting more control over community governance and moderation.

## Technical Foundation

Xeadline is built on:

- **Nostr Protocol**: A simple, open protocol for decentralized social networking
- **Lightning Network**: Bitcoin's layer 2 scaling solution enabling fast, low-cost payments
- **Next.js**: React framework for the frontend application
- **TailwindCSS**: For styling with a bottle green (#006a4e) primary color theme
- **Redux**: For state management

The application connects to the same Nostr relay as xeadline-news (wss://relay.xeadline.com) and implements various Nostr Implementation Possibilities (NIPs) for functionality like reactions, replies, and moderated communities.

## MVP Scope

The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) focuses on delivering core Reddit-like functionality with decentralized underpinnings:

1. **User Authentication**: Key generation, private key login, extension support, and nsec key import
2. **Community System**: Creation, discovery, subscription, and flexible moderation options
3. **Content Creation**: Rich text posts with image embedding and nested comments
4. **Voting System**: Upvotes and downvotes using Nostr reactions
5. **Lightning Integration**: Basic tipping and anti-spam measures
6. **Performance Optimization**: Multi-level caching for responsive experience

## Development Approach

The development follows a phased approach:

1. **Foundation** (Weeks 1-4): Core infrastructure, authentication, and basic UI
2. **Core Functionality** (Weeks 5-8): Communities, content creation, voting, and moderation
3. **Enhanced Features** (Weeks 9-12): Lightning integration, search, and performance optimization
4. **Beta Release** (Weeks 13-16): Testing, refinement, and initial user onboarding
5. **Public Launch & Growth** (Months 5-6): Open registration and community building
6. **Advanced Features** (Months 7-12): Enhanced Lightning features, media capabilities, and developer ecosystem
7. **Mobile Applications** (Year 2): Native iOS and Android applications
