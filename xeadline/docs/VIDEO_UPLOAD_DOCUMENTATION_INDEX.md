# Video Upload Documentation Index

## Overview

This document serves as an index for all documentation related to video uploads in the Xeadline application. It provides a comprehensive overview of the current implementation, identified issues, research findings, and proposed solutions.

## Current Issues

The current video upload implementation has several issues:

1. **Performance Issues**: Video uploads are taking longer than expected (2.2+ minutes for a ~30MB file)
2. **Preview Problems**: Video previews are not displaying after upload
3. **File Format Issues**: Files may not be properly recognized as videos in Vercel Blob storage
4. **Resource Intensive**: The upload process is causing high CPU usage and heating up devices

## Key Findings

### Vercel Blob Storage Limitations

1. **Content Type Handling**: Vercel Blob may not properly handle certain video content types or may strip metadata needed for proper playback.
2. **No Transcoding**: Vercel Blob doesn't provide built-in video transcoding services, unlike dedicated video platforms.
3. **Limited Streaming Optimization**: Unlike dedicated video platforms, Vercel Blob doesn't optimize for adaptive bitrate streaming.

### Recommended Approaches

#### Short-term Improvements

1. **Content Type Verification**: Ensure proper content type headers are set and preserved during upload
2. **Direct Upload Implementation**: Use Vercel's direct upload URLs for better performance
3. **Improved Progress Tracking**: Provide accurate progress tracking with multiple stages

#### Medium-term Solutions

1. **Client-side Video Validation**: Validate videos before upload to prevent issues
2. **Optimized Chunked Upload**: Implement adaptive chunk sizing and parallel uploads
3. **Video Preview Optimization**: Ensure video previews load correctly after upload

#### Long-term Solutions

1. **Client-Side Compression**: Implement optional client-side compression for videos
2. **Integration with Dedicated Video Service**: Consider using a specialized video service
3. **Enhanced Video Player**: Implement a custom video player optimized for the application

## Implementation Priorities

1. **Phase 1 (1-2 weeks)**: Fix immediate issues with content type handling, implement direct uploads, and improve progress tracking
2. **Phase 2 (2-4 weeks)**: Enhance the upload experience with client-side validation, optimized chunked uploads, and better preview handling
3. **Phase 3 (4-8 weeks)**: Implement advanced features like client-side compression, integration with dedicated video services, and a custom video player
