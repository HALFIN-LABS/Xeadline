## Updated Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure & Reliability (2 Weeks)

#### 1.1 Event Management Refactor âœ…

**Description**: Implement a unified event handling system that centralizes all Nostr event creation, validation, signing, and publishing operations. This system will replace the current scattered approach with a robust, consistent architecture that ensures reliable event handling across the platform. The refactor will include comprehensive error handling, retry mechanisms, validation rules, and monitoring to guarantee event delivery while maintaining proper event structure according to Nostr specifications.

**Why This Matters**:
The current event handling system is scattered across multiple components, making it difficult to maintain consistency and reliability. By unifying event management, we'll improve reliability, make debugging easier, and enable better error recovery.

**Current vs New Approach**:
- Currently: Events are handled directly by individual components, leading to duplicated code and inconsistent error handling
- New System: Centralized event management with clear separation of concerns and consistent handling

**How It Works**:
The EventManager acts as a central coordinator for all event-related operations. When a component needs to create or publish an event:
1. The event is first validated by the ValidationService
2. It's then queued by the QueueManager to prevent system overload
3. The SigningService handles the actual event signing
4. Finally, the PublishingService ensures reliable delivery to relays

**Implementation Status**:
âœ… Completed. We've implemented a comprehensive Event Management System with:
- EventManager as the central coordinator
- ValidationService for event validation
- SigningService with support for multiple signing methods
- PublishingService with retry logic
- QueueManager for prioritized event processing
- EventMonitor for tracking and metrics
- Backward-compatible adapters for existing code

The system is now integrated across the application, providing improved reliability, better error handling, and consistent event management.

**Technical Details**:
```typescript
class EventManager {
  private signingService: EventSigningService;
  private publishingService: EventPublishingService;
  private validationService: EventValidationService;
  private queueManager: EventQueueManager;
  private eventMonitor: EventMonitor;

  async signAndPublish(event: UnsignedEvent): Promise<SignAndPublishResult> {
    // Validate event
    await this.validationService.validate(event);
    
    // Add to queue
    const queuedEvent = await this.queueManager.enqueue(event);
    
    // Sign event
    const signedEvent = await this.signingService.sign(queuedEvent);
    
    // Publish with retries
    return this.publishingService.publish(signedEvent);
  }
}
```

#### 1.2 Storage Service Abstraction âœ…

**Description**: Create a pluggable storage system that decouples the application from specific storage providers through a well-defined abstraction layer. This architecture will implement the provider pattern to allow seamless switching between different storage solutions (Vercel Blob, Supabase Storage, etc.) without modifying application code. The system will include automatic fallback mechanisms, performance monitoring, caching strategies, and a unified API for all file operations including uploads, retrievals, and management functions.

**Why This Matters**:
Our current direct dependency on centralized storage services (Vercel Blob/Supabase) makes it difficult to adapt to changing requirements. A pluggable storage system will allow us to switch providers or implement hybrid solutions as needed.

**Current vs New Approach**:
- Currently: Direct integration with Vercel Blob and Supabase, making it hard to switch or use alternative storage solutions
- New System: Abstract storage interface that can work with any storage provider

**How It Works**:
The storage system uses a provider pattern where each storage solution implements a common interface:
1. Applications always interact with the abstract StorageProvider interface
2. The CachingStorageProvider adds a caching layer for performance
3. Different implementations can be swapped or used together
4. Automatic fallback ensures reliability during provider transitions

**Implementation Status**:
âœ… Completed. We've implemented a comprehensive Storage Service Abstraction with:
- StorageProvider interface defining a common API for all storage providers
- VercelBlobProvider implementation using Vercel Blob
- CachingStorageProvider for improved performance
- StorageService to manage providers and provide a unified API
- Comprehensive documentation and testing tools
- Integration with existing image upload functionality

The system now provides a flexible foundation for file storage that can easily adapt to changing requirements.

**Technical Details**:
```typescript
interface StorageProvider {
  store(data: any, options: StorageOptions): Promise<StorageResult>;
  retrieve(id: string): Promise<any>;
  delete(id: string): Promise<boolean>;
  list(filter: StorageFilter): Promise<string[]>;
  getUrl(id: string): string;
}

class CachingStorageProvider implements StorageProvider {
  constructor(
    private primaryProvider: StorageProvider,
    private defaultTtl: number = 3600
  ) {}

  async store(data: any, options: StorageOptions): Promise<StorageResult> {
    const result = await this.primaryProvider.store(data, options);
    // Cache the result if it's a Blob or File
    if (data instanceof Blob || data instanceof File) {
      const ttl = options?.ttl || this.defaultTtl;
      this.cache.set(result.id, data, ttl);
    }
    return result;
  }
}
```

    return this.connectToRelay(scores[0].url);
  }

  private async measureRelayPerformance(relay: RelayConnection): Promise<void> {
    const startTime = performance.now();
    await relay.ping();
    const latency = performance.now() - startTime;
    await this.metrics.recordLatency(relay.url, latency);
  }
}
```

#### 3.2 Caching Implementation

**Description**: Create a multi-layered caching architecture that dramatically improves application performance and enables offline functionality. This system will combine browser-based caching strategies (Service Workers, IndexedDB, memory caches) with intelligent data management policies to minimize network requests and provide instant data access. Key features include a Least Recently Used (LRU) cache for frequently accessed content, predictive prefetching based on user behavior patterns, background synchronization for offline-to-online transitions, smart cache invalidation to prevent stale data, and a configurable caching policy framework that can be tuned for different content types and user scenarios.

};

// Skeleton loading component
function SkeletonLoader({ type }: { type: 'post' | 'comment' | 'profile' }) {
  const classes = {
    post: 'h-32 w-full',
    comment: 'h-24 w-full',
    profile: 'h-48 w-full'
  };
  
  return (
    <div
      className={`animate-pulse bg-gray-200 dark:bg-gray-700 rounded-md ${classes[type]}`}
    />
  );
}

// Theme configuration

    // Post creation
    this.shortcuts.set('ctrl+p', () => this.createPost());
    
    // Navigation
    this.shortcuts.set('g h', () => this.navigateHome());
    this.shortcuts.set('g p', () => this.navigateProfile());
    
    // Content interaction
    this.shortcuts.set('j', () => this.nextItem());
    this.shortcuts.set('k', () => this.previousItem());
  }

  async handleDragDrop(event: DragEvent): Promise<void> {
    const files = event.dataTransfer?.files;
    if (files?.length) {
      await this.handleFileUpload(files);
    }
  }
}
```

### Phase 6: Link Sharing & Preview System (2 Weeks)

**Why This Matters**:
When users share Xeadline content on other platforms, we need to provide rich, informative previews that work well with social media and messaging apps. Since our content is decentralized on Nostr, generating these previews directly would be slow and unreliable. This system ensures fast, consistent previews while maintaining decentralization.

#### 6.1 Metadata Cache Service

**Description**: Develop a specialized caching system that enables fast, reliable link previews for content shared both within the platform and on external services. This system will automatically generate and store metadata (titles, descriptions, images, etc.) for all shareable content with appropriate time-to-live settings, serve preview requests from cache for instant response times, maintain background jobs that keep cache data fresh and accurate, and generate previews in multiple formats to support different sharing destinations (OpenGraph for Facebook, Twitter Cards, etc.). The implementation will optimize for both performance and accuracy, ensuring that shared content always presents well regardless of where it's shared while minimizing the computational overhead of preview generation.

**Why This Matters**:
Preview generation from decentralized content can be slow and unreliable. The metadata cache ensures instant preview availability while keeping the content decentralized. This is crucial for social sharing where users expect immediate feedback.

**Current vs New Approach**:
- Currently: No preview system, links appear as basic URLs without context
- New System: Rich previews with images, titles, and descriptions served instantly from cache

**How It Works**:
1. When content is created or updated, preview metadata is automatically generated
2. Metadata is stored in Supabase with appropriate TTL (Time To Live)
3. Preview requests are served from cache for instant response
4. Background jobs keep cache updated with latest content from Nostr
5. Different preview formats (OpenGraph, Twitter Cards) are pre-generated

**Tasks**:
- Create Supabase metadata table
- Implement cache service
- Add background update system
- Create preview generation service

**Technical Details**:
```typescript
interface MetadataCache {
  store(key: string, metadata: PageMetadata, ttl: number): Promise<void>;
  retrieve(key: string): Promise<PageMetadata | null>;
  invalidate(key: string): Promise<void>;
}

class SupabaseMetadataCache implements MetadataCache {
  private table = 'page_metadata';
  
  async store(key: string, metadata: PageMetadata, ttl: number): Promise<void> {
    await supabase
      .from(this.table)
      .upsert({
        key,
        metadata,
        expires_at: new Date(Date.now() + ttl * 1000).toISOString()
      });
  }
}
```

#### 6.2 Share System Implementation

**Description**: Build a versatile content sharing system that works seamlessly across all devices and platforms while providing valuable analytics on sharing patterns. This system will intelligently detect device capabilities to use native sharing APIs when available (Web Share API on supporting browsers), implement robust fallback mechanisms with clear user feedback when native sharing isn't available (clipboard copy with confirmation), track all sharing actions to gather insights on popular content and sharing channels, integrate with the metadata cache to ensure rich previews on external platforms, and provide engagement metrics to help content creators understand their reach. The implementation will prioritize a frictionless sharing experience that encourages content distribution while respecting user privacy and platform performance constraints.

**Why This Matters**:
Easy content sharing is crucial for platform growth and user engagement. We need a system that works across all devices and platforms, with fallbacks for different capabilities. This system needs to track sharing analytics to understand user behavior and improve the sharing experience.

**Current vs New Approach**:
- Currently: Basic URL copying without tracking or analytics
- New System: Native sharing with fallbacks, analytics, and tracking

**How It Works**:
1. System detects device capabilities (Web Share API, clipboard API)
2. Uses native sharing when available for best integration
3. Falls back to clipboard with clear feedback when needed
4. Tracks all sharing actions for analytics
5. Integrates with the metadata cache for rich previews
6. Provides share counts and engagement metrics

**Tasks**:
- Implement share buttons
- Add copy to clipboard fallback
- Create share analytics
- Implement share tracking

**Technical Details**:
```typescript
class ShareManager {
  async share(content: ShareableContent): Promise<ShareResult> {
    // Try native share
    if (navigator.share) {
      return this.nativeShare(content);
    }
    
    // Fallback to clipboard
    return this.clipboardShare(content);
  }

  private async trackShare(content: ShareableContent, method: ShareMethod): Promise<void> {
    await analytics.track('content_shared', {
      contentType: content.type,
      contentId: content.id,
      shareMethod: method
    });
  }
}
```

### Phase 7: Quality Assurance (2 Weeks)
