- mkcert
- PostgreSQL 14.0
- Redis
- Node v18
- Typescript

### Steps

1. Install Docker Desktop by following the official guide. Ensure you install it from the official source and not through package managers like Snap, Brew, or Debian repositories, as these may lead to errors.

2. Clone the Nostream repository and navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:Cameri/nostream.git
   cd nostream
   ```

3. Generate a secret key using the following command:

   ```bash
   openssl rand -hex 128
   ```

4. Create a .env file in the project directory and paste the generated secret key into it:
   ```
   SECRET=your_generated_secret_key
   ```

The docker-compose.yml file defines the services for the Nostr relay, including the Nostream application, PostgreSQL database, and Redis cache. It specifies the image, environment variables, ports, volumes, and dependencies for each service.

5. Start Nostream using Docker Compose:

   ```bash
   ./scripts/start
   ```

   Alternatively, you can start Nostream with Tor support using:

   ```bash
   ./scripts/start_with_tor
   ```

6. To stop the server, run:

   ```bash
   ./scripts/stop
   ```

7. To print the Tor hostname (if running with Tor support), run:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/print_tor_hostname
   ```

## Understanding the Nostr Protocol

Before deploying Nostream for relay.xeadline.com, it's crucial to understand the core concepts of the Nostr protocol.

Nostr is a simple, open protocol that enables decentralized and censorship-resistant communication. It allows users to publish content and subscribe to feeds without relying on centralized platforms. This decentralized architecture offers several benefits, including:

- Increased resilience: No single point of failure, making the network more robust.
- Reduced censorship: No central authority can control or restrict content.
- Enhanced privacy: Users have more control over their data.
- Greater user empowerment: Users can choose their own relays and clients.

Nostr works by allowing users to:

- Create events (JSON blobs) containing messages or other data.
- Sign these events with their private key.
- Publish these signed events to relays.
- Subscribe to events from other users through relays.

Relays are responsible for storing and distributing events to subscribed users. Users can connect to multiple relays to ensure redundancy and avoid censorship. Users are identified by their public keys, tagged as "npub" keys. Different extensions to the Nostr protocol are called Nostr Implementation Possibilities, or "NIPs".

## Requirements for relay.xeadline.com

The specific requirements for relay.xeadline.com should be considered when configuring and deploying Nostream. These may include:

- Scalability: The relay should be able to handle a large number of users and events.
- Security: The relay should be secured against attacks and unauthorized access.
- Features: The relay may need to support specific features like NIP-05 verification or paid subscriptions.

Scalability is a critical consideration for any Nostr relay. As the user base and event volume grow, the relay needs to handle the increased load without performance degradation. Strategies for mitigating scalability challenges include:

- Optimizing database performance and using read replicas.
- Implementing efficient caching mechanisms.
- Scaling the relay infrastructure horizontally by adding more servers.
- Using load balancing to distribute traffic across multiple relays.

## Setting Up and Configuring Nostr

Nostream can be configured by modifying the settings.yaml file located in the .nostr directory within the project root. This file allows you to customize various aspects of the relay, including:

- Relay information: Name, description, contact information, and public key.
- Network settings: Maximum payload size, supported event kinds, and rate limits.
- Database settings: PostgreSQL connection details and read replica configuration.
- Payment settings: Enable or disable payments, configure payment processors, and set fee schedules.
- Mirroring settings: Configure mirroring from other relays.
- Worker settings: Number of worker processes to handle incoming connections.

## Security Considerations

Security is paramount for any Nostr relay to protect user data and maintain the integrity of the network. Nostream offers various security features and configuration options, including:

- TLS encryption: Secure communication between clients and the relay using TLS 1.2.
- Cipher suite support: Configure supported cipher suites for TLS connections.
- Access control: Restrict access to the relay based on IP addresses or public keys.

Ensure the configuration in settings.yaml meets the specific requirements of relay.xeadline.com.

To ensure the security of the relay, consider implementing the following best practices:

- Regularly update Nostream to the latest version to patch security vulnerabilities.
- Use strong passwords and enable two-factor authentication for accessing the relay server.
- Monitor logs for suspicious activity and implement intrusion detection systems.
- Configure firewalls to restrict unnecessary network traffic.
- Regularly back up the relay's data to prevent data loss in case of an attack.

   map $http_upgrade $connection_upgrade {
       default upgrade;
       '' close;
   }

   upstream websocket {
       server 127.0.0.1:8080;
   }

   server {
       listen 80;
       server_name relay.xeadline.com;

       location /.well-known/acme-challenge/ {
           root /var/www/nostr;
           allow all;
       }

       location / {
           proxy_pass http://websocket;
           proxy_http_version 1.1;
           proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
           proxy_set_header Connection $connection_upgrade;
       }
   }
   ```

5. Domain and DNS Configuration: To make the relay accessible to users, you need to set up a domain and configure DNS records. You can either create a CNAME record that points to the public DNS of your server or create an A record entry that points to the public IP address of your server.
