# Video Upload Optimization for Vercel Blob Storage

## Current Issues

Based on our implementation and testing, we've identified several issues with video uploads to Vercel Blob storage:

1. **Performance Issues**: Video uploads are taking longer than expected (2.2+ minutes for a ~30MB file)
2. **Preview Problems**: Video previews are not displaying after upload
3. **File Format Issues**: Files may not be properly recognized as videos in Vercel Blob storage
4. **Resource Intensive**: The upload process is causing high CPU usage and heating up devices

## Vercel Blob Storage Research

### Limitations and Considerations

Vercel Blob Storage has several limitations that affect video uploads:

1. **Content Type Handling**: Vercel Blob may not properly handle certain video content types or may strip metadata needed for proper playback.
2. **Size Limits**: While Vercel Blob supports files up to 500MB, there are practical limitations for web-based uploads.
3. **Edge Network**: Vercel's edge network is optimized for static assets, not necessarily for streaming video content.
4. **No Transcoding**: Vercel Blob doesn't provide built-in video transcoding services, unlike dedicated video platforms.
5. **Metadata Preservation**: It's unclear if Vercel Blob preserves all video metadata during storage.

### Best Practices for Vercel Blob

Based on Vercel's documentation and community feedback:

1. **Content-Type Headers**: Ensure proper content-type headers are set during upload (`video/mp4`, etc.)
2. **Direct Upload URLs**: For large files, use Vercel's direct upload URLs rather than proxying through API routes
3. **Chunked Uploads**: Use chunked uploads for large files, but be aware of potential issues with reassembly
4. **Cache-Control Headers**: Set appropriate cache-control headers for video content
5. **CDN Configuration**: Ensure CDN is configured correctly for video content

## Video Compression Options

### Client-Side Compression

1. **FFmpeg.wasm**: Browser-based video compression using WebAssembly
   - Pros: No server dependency, reduces upload size
   - Cons: CPU intensive, may not work well on mobile devices

2. **Video Compression API**: Use the browser's built-in video compression capabilities
   - Pros: Native browser support, no external dependencies
   - Cons: Limited control over compression settings, inconsistent browser support

3. **Canvas-based Compression**: Capture frames to canvas and re-encode at lower quality
   - Pros: Works across browsers, customizable quality
   - Cons: Lossy compression, may affect video quality significantly

### Server-Side Compression

1. **FFmpeg on Edge Functions**: Use Vercel Edge Functions with FFmpeg
   - Pros: Powerful compression options, offloads work from client
   - Cons: Edge function time limits, potential costs

2. **Dedicated Video Processing Service**: Use a third-party service like Cloudinary, Mux, or AWS Elastic Transcoder
   - Pros: Professional-grade transcoding, multiple formats and qualities
   - Cons: Additional costs, integration complexity

3. **Self-hosted Processing**: Process videos on your own infrastructure before uploading to Vercel
   - Pros: Complete control over processing
   - Cons: Infrastructure costs, maintenance overhead

## Recommended Solutions

Based on our research, here are recommended approaches to improve video uploads:

### Short-term Improvements

1. **Content Type Verification**:
   ```typescript
   // Ensure content type is explicitly set and preserved
   const result = await storageService.store(fileBuffer, {
     contentType: file.type, // Ensure this is correctly set
     metadata: {
       originalContentType: file.type, // Store original content type as backup
       ...otherMetadata
     },
     cacheControl: 'public, max-age=31536000'
   });
   ```

2. **Metadata Preservation**:
   ```typescript
   // Extract and preserve video metadata
   const extractMetadata = (file) => {
     return new Promise((resolve) => {
       const video = document.createElement('video');
       video.preload = 'metadata';
       video.onloadedmetadata = () => {
         resolve({
           duration: video.duration,
           width: video.videoWidth,
           height: video.videoHeight
         });
       };
       video.src = URL.createObjectURL(file);
     });
   };
   
   // Add this metadata to the upload
   const metadata = await extractMetadata(file);
   ```

3. **Direct Upload Implementation**:
   ```typescript
   // Use Vercel's recommended direct upload pattern
   const { url } = await fetch('/api/get-upload-url').then(r => r.json());
   await fetch(url, {
     method: 'PUT',
     headers: {
       'Content-Type': file.type,
     },
     body: file
   });
   ```

### Medium-term Solutions

1. **Client-side Compression with FFmpeg.wasm**:
   - Implement optional client-side compression for videos over a certain size
   - Allow users to choose between quality and upload speed

2. **Progress UI Improvements**:
   - Implement a more detailed progress UI showing different stages:
     - Compression (if applicable)
     - Upload progress per chunk
     - Processing status
     - Preview generation

3. **Adaptive Chunk Size**:
   - Implement network speed detection to adjust chunk size dynamically
   - Slower connections use smaller chunks, faster connections use larger chunks

### Long-term Solutions

1. **Dedicated Video Processing Service**:
   - Integrate with a specialized video service like Mux, Cloudinary, or AWS MediaConvert
   - Offload transcoding, thumbnail generation, and streaming optimization

2. **Custom Video Player**:
   - Implement a custom video player optimized for the formats and delivery method
   - Support adaptive bitrate streaming for better playback experience

3. **Progressive Upload and Playback**:
   - Allow videos to be viewed while still uploading (for longer videos)
   - Implement partial upload recovery for interrupted uploads

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Immediate Fixes

1. Fix content type handling in the current implementation:
   - Ensure proper content type headers are set
   - Verify metadata is preserved during upload
   - Test with various video formats to ensure compatibility

2. Implement basic client-side video validation:
   - Check if the video is playable before upload
   - Extract basic metadata (duration, dimensions)
   - Provide feedback to users about potential issues

3. Improve error handling and reporting:
   - Add detailed logging for upload failures
   - Implement retry logic with exponential backoff
   - Provide clear error messages to users

### Phase 2: Enhanced Upload Experience

1. Implement optional client-side compression:
   - Add FFmpeg.wasm for browser-based compression
   - Provide quality/size tradeoff options
   - Show estimated upload time based on file size and connection speed

2. Improve chunked upload implementation:
   - Optimize chunk size based on network conditions
   - Implement true parallel uploads with proper progress tracking
   - Add server-side validation of chunks before assembly

3. Enhance preview generation:
   - Generate thumbnails during upload process
   - Provide immediate feedback once upload completes
   - Support various video formats and codecs

### Phase 3: Professional Video Handling

1. Evaluate and integrate with a dedicated video service:
   - Research options (Mux, Cloudinary, etc.)
   - Implement server-side integration
   - Set up transcoding workflows

2. Implement adaptive streaming:
   - Generate multiple quality levels
   - Support HLS or DASH streaming
   - Optimize for mobile and desktop viewing

3. Add advanced video features:
   - Chapters/segments
   - Custom thumbnails
   - Captions and subtitles

## Conclusion

The current implementation of video uploads to Vercel Blob storage has several limitations that affect performance and user experience. By implementing the recommended short-term fixes, we can improve reliability and ensure videos are properly stored and displayed. Medium and long-term solutions will provide a more robust and user-friendly experience, particularly for larger videos or users with slower connections.

For optimal video handling, we should consider moving to a dedicated video processing service in the future, as this would provide professional-grade transcoding, adaptive streaming, and better playback experiences across devices.
