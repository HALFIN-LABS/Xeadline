# Vercel Blob Storage for Video Content

## Overview

Vercel Blob Storage is a serverless blob storage solution designed primarily for static assets like images, documents, and other files. While it can store video files, it's not specifically optimized for video content delivery like dedicated video platforms. This document explores the capabilities, limitations, and best practices for using Vercel Blob with video content.

## Technical Specifications

- **Storage Limits**: Up to 500MB per file
- **Total Storage**: Based on your Vercel plan
- **Edge Network**: Content delivered via Vercel's global edge network
- **Content Types**: Supports all content types, including video formats
- **Access Control**: Public or private access options
- **Pricing**: Pay-as-you-go based on storage and bandwidth

## Video-Specific Considerations

### Supported Video Formats

Vercel Blob can store any video format, but browser compatibility varies:

| Format | File Extension | MIME Type | Browser Support |
|--------|---------------|-----------|----------------|
| MP4 (H.264) | .mp4 | video/mp4 | Excellent (all modern browsers) |
| WebM | .webm | video/webm | Good (Chrome, Firefox, Edge) |
| Ogg | .ogv | video/ogg | Limited (mainly Firefox) |
| QuickTime | .mov | video/quicktime | Limited (mainly Safari) |
| MPEG-TS | .ts | video/mp2t | Limited |

For maximum compatibility, MP4 with H.264 encoding is recommended.

### Content-Type Headers

Proper content-type headers are crucial for video playback. When uploading videos to Vercel Blob, ensure the correct MIME type is set:

```typescript
const result = await put(fileName, file, {
  contentType: 'video/mp4', // Must match the actual video format
  access: 'public',
});
```

### Metadata Preservation

Vercel Blob may not preserve all video metadata during storage. Important metadata includes:

- Duration
- Resolution
- Codec information
- Frame rate
- Bitrate

Consider extracting and storing this metadata separately if needed for your application.

## Performance Optimization

### Chunked Uploads

For large video files, chunked uploads are recommended:

1. **Optimal Chunk Size**: 5-10MB per chunk is generally a good balance
2. **Concurrency**: 3-5 concurrent chunk uploads typically works well
3. **Reassembly**: Server-side reassembly must be handled carefully

### Direct Upload URLs

For better performance, use Vercel's direct upload URLs:

```typescript
// Server-side
import { put } from '@vercel/blob';

export async function POST(request: Request) {
  const { searchParams } = new URL(request.url);
  const filename = searchParams.get('filename');
  
  // Create a direct upload URL
  const { url, uploadUrl } = await put(filename, {
    access: 'public',
    contentType: 'video/mp4',
  });
  
  return Response.json({ url, uploadUrl });
}

// Client-side
const { url, uploadUrl } = await fetch('/api/upload?filename=video.mp4').then(r => r.json());
await fetch(uploadUrl, {
  method: 'PUT',
  body: videoFile,
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'video/mp4',
  },
});
```

### Streaming Considerations

Vercel Blob doesn't natively support video streaming protocols like HLS or DASH. For better video streaming:

1. **Range Requests**: Ensure your application handles HTTP range requests for seeking
2. **Preload Metadata**: Use the `preload="metadata"` attribute in video tags
3. **CDN Configuration**: Configure appropriate caching for video content

## Limitations and Challenges

### No Built-in Transcoding

Vercel Blob doesn't provide video transcoding services. Videos are stored and served exactly as uploaded.

### Limited Streaming Optimization

Unlike dedicated video platforms, Vercel Blob doesn't optimize for adaptive bitrate streaming.

### Metadata Handling

Video metadata may not be fully preserved or accessible after upload.

### Processing Time Limits

Vercel Functions have execution time limits (10-60 seconds depending on plan), which can affect video processing capabilities.

## Alternative Approaches

### Hybrid Approach with Dedicated Video Services

A common pattern is to use Vercel Blob for temporary storage and a dedicated video service for processing:

1. Upload video to Vercel Blob
2. Trigger processing with a dedicated service (Mux, Cloudinary, etc.)
3. Store the processed video URL in your database

### Client-Side Processing

For smaller videos, consider client-side processing before upload:

1. Use FFmpeg.wasm for browser-based transcoding
2. Compress video to an appropriate size/quality
3. Upload the processed video to Vercel Blob

### Edge Function Processing

For simple video processing, Vercel Edge Functions can be used:

1. Upload video to Vercel Blob
2. Use Edge Functions to generate thumbnails or extract metadata
3. Store processed results alongside the original video

## Implementation Recommendations

### Short Videos (< 50MB)

For shorter videos, direct uploads to Vercel Blob can work well:

```typescript
// Client-side upload with progress
const uploadVideo = async (file) => {
  const formData = new FormData();
  formData.append('file', file);
  
  const xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
  xhr.open('POST', '/api/upload-video');
  
  xhr.upload.onprogress = (event) => {
    if (event.lengthComputable) {
      const progress = Math.round((event.loaded / event.total) * 100);
      updateProgress(progress);
    }
  };
  
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    xhr.onload = () => {
      if (xhr.status >= 200 && xhr.status < 300) {
        resolve(JSON.parse(xhr.responseText));
      } else {
        reject(new Error(`HTTP error ${xhr.status}`));
      }
    };
    xhr.onerror = () => reject(new Error('Network error'));
    xhr.send(formData);
  });
};
```

### Medium Videos (50-150MB)

For medium-sized videos, use chunked uploads:

```typescript
// Simplified chunked upload example
const uploadInChunks = async (file, chunkSize = 5 * 1024 * 1024) => {
  const totalChunks = Math.ceil(file.size / chunkSize);
  const uploadId = await initializeUpload(file.name, totalChunks);
  
  for (let i = 0; i < totalChunks; i++) {
    const start = i * chunkSize;
    const end = Math.min(start + chunkSize, file.size);
    const chunk = file.slice(start, end);
    
    await uploadChunk(uploadId, i, chunk);
    updateProgress(Math.round((i + 1) / totalChunks * 90));
  }
  
  const result = await completeUpload(uploadId);
  updateProgress(100);
  return result;
};
```

### Large Videos (>150MB)

For larger videos, consider:

1. Client-side compression before upload
2. Integration with a dedicated video service
3. Breaking the video into smaller segments

## Conclusion

Vercel Blob Storage can handle video content, but it has limitations compared to dedicated video platforms. For simple use cases and smaller videos, it can be a cost-effective solution. For more advanced video needs, consider a hybrid approach with dedicated video services or implement client-side optimizations.

By understanding these limitations and implementing the recommended optimizations, you can improve the performance and reliability of video uploads in your Vercel-hosted applications.
